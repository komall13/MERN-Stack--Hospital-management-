# MERN-Stack--Hospital-management-
The Hospital Management System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) is a comprehensive and user-friendly web application designed to streamline and digitize hospital operations.
This project provides an efficient platform that benefits both doctors and patients by enabling seamless management of appointments, medical records, patient histories, and communication. Doctors can view and update patient data, prescribe medications, and manage schedules, while patients can register, book appointments, view prescriptions, and access health records securely. By leveraging the power of modern web technologies, this system improves operational efficiency, reduces paperwork, and enhances the overall patient care experience.
